### Author: flxkbr

A C# utility library implementing simple algorithms for hexagonal-tile based maps for 2D games, aimed at use with Unity3D.

This is a quick and dirty implementation of the coordinate systems and algorithms presented on the [Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) website.
